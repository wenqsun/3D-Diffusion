   This survey paper provides insightful introductions about diffusion models and applications, including 2D, 3D, video, and 4D.

## Direct 3D Generation via Diffusion Models
This series of papers are focused on modeling the distribution of 3D shapes. Eventually, 3D content/model can be directly generated by the well-trained 3D diffusion models.
